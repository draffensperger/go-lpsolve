[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/draffensperger/golp?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/draffensperger/golp) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/draffensperger/golp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/draffensperger/golp) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/draffensperger/golp/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/draffensperger/golp)

Golp is a Golang wrapper for the [LPSolve](http://lpsolve.sourceforge.net/5.5/) linear (and integer) programming library.

## Installation

**Step 1: Get the golp Go code**

```
go get -d github.com/draffensperger/golp
```

**Step 2: Get the LPSolve library**

Golp is configured to dynamically link to LPSolve and expects lpsolve to reside in the following places:

Mac: `/opt/local/includes/lpsolve` && `/opt/local/lib` which is where ports puts it.

Linux (general): `$GOPATH/src/github.com/draffensperger/golp/lpsolve`.

Windows (general): `$GOPATH/src/github.com/draffensperger/golp@xxx/lpsolve`.

You will need an LPSolve library
suitable for your operating system, which you can
[get from SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/lpsolve/files/lpsolve/5.5.2.0/).

Here's how you could download and extract the LPSolve library for 64-bit Linux:

```
LP_URL=http://sourceforge.net/projects/lpsolve/files/lpsolve/5.5.2.0/lp_solve_5.5.2.0_dev_ux64.tar.gz
LP_DIR=$GOPATH/src/github.com/draffensperger/golp/lpsolve
mkdir -p $LP_DIR
curl -L $LP_URL | tar xvz -C $LP_DIR
```

Here's how you could download the LPSolve library for 64-bit windows:
```
https://sourceforge.net/projects/lpsolve/files/lpsolve/5.5.2.0/lp_solve_5.5.2.0_dev_win64.zip/download
````
Then extract content zip file in `$GOPATH/src/github.com/draffensperger/golp@xxx/lpsolve`.
Finally, copy `lpsolve55.dll` file into your golang project directory (or maybe into `c:\windows\system32`).

To install LPSolve on Mac OS X, install [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/),
then run `sudo port install lp_solve`.

On Debian 8+ you can install the lpsolve package with `sudo apt-get install liblpsolve55-dev` and then just remove the two `#cgo linux` lines in `lp.go` and that will work as well.

With some configuration changes, it would be possible to statically link to
LPSolve but that may have licensing/distribution implications for your project
since LP Solve is [LGPL licensed](http://lpsolve.sourceforge.net/5.5/LGPL.htm).

## Usage

Not all LPSolve functions are supported, but it's currently possible to run a
simple linear and integer program using golp. For details, see the
[golp GoDoc page](http://godoc.org/github.com/draffensperger/golp).

Feel free to open a GitHub issue or pull request if you'd like more functions added.

### Example with real-valued variables

The example below in an adaption of an example in the
[LP Solve documentation.](http://lpsolve.sourceforge.net/5.5/formulate.htm)
for maximizing a farmer's profit.

```
package main

import "fmt"
import "github.com/draffensperger/golp"

func main() {
  lp := golp.NewLP(0, 2)
  lp.AddConstraint([]float64{110.0, 30.0}, golp.LE, 4000.0)
  lp.AddConstraint([]float64{1.0, 1.0}, golp.LE, 75.0)
  lp.SetObjFn([]float64{143.0, 60.0})
  lp.SetMaximize()

  lp.Solve()
  vars := lp.Variables()
  fmt.Printf("Plant %.3f acres of barley\n", vars[0])
  fmt.Printf("And  %.3f acres of wheat\n", vars[1])
  fmt.Printf("For optimal profit of $%.2f\n", lp.Objective())

  // No need to explicitly free underlying C structure as golp.LP finalizer will
}
```

Outputs:
```
Plant 21.875 acres of barley
And  53.125 acres of wheat
For optimal profit of $6315.62
```

### MIP (Mixed Integer Programming) example

LPSolve also supports setting variables to be integral or binary and uses the
branch-and-bound algorithm for such problems. This example is from the
[LPSolve integer variables documentation](http://lpsolve.sourceforge.net/5.5/integer.htm).


```
import "fmt"
import "github.com/draffensperger/golp"

func main() {
  lp := golp.NewLP(0, 4)
  lp.AddConstraintSparse([]golp.Entry{{0, 1.0}, {1, 1.0}}, golp.LE, 5.0)
  lp.AddConstraintSparse([]golp.Entry{{0, 2.0}, {1, -1.0}}, golp.GE, 0.0)
  lp.AddConstraintSparse([]golp.Entry{{0, 1.0}, {1, 3.0}}, golp.GE, 0.0)
  lp.AddConstraintSparse([]golp.Entry{{2, 1.0}, {3, 1.0}}, golp.GE, 0.5)
  lp.AddConstraintSparse([]golp.Entry{{2, 1.0}}, golp.GE, 1.1)
  lp.SetObjFn([]float64{-1.0, -2.0, 0.1, 3.0})
  lp.SetInt(2, true)
  lp.Solve()

  fmt.Printf("Objective value: %v\n", lp.Objective())
  vars := lp.Variables()
  fmt.Printf("Variable values:\n")
  for i := 0; i < lp.NumCols(); i++ {
    fmt.Printf("x%v = %v\n", i + 1, vars[i])
  }
}
```

Outputs:
```
Objective value: -8.133333333333333
Variable values:
x1 = 1.6666666666666665
x2 = 3.333333333333333
x3 = 2
x4 = 0
```

## Alternative linear / mixed integer solver libraries

There are also Go bindings for the GPL-licensed
[GNU Linear Programming Kit (GLPK)](http://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/) at
[github.com/lukpank/go-glpk](https://github.com/lukpank/go-glpk).

The Google [or-tools](https://github.com/google/or-tools) project provides a C++
SWIG compatible inteface for a number of other linear and mixed integer solvers
like CBC, CLP, GLOP, Gurobi, CPLEX, SCIP, and Sulum.
There is Go support [for SWIG bindings](http://www.swig.org/Doc2.0/Go.html), so
it should be possible to write a wrapper that would connect to those other
solvers via the or-tools library as well.
